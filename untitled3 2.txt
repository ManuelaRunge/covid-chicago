##Notes:


* different versions:
** simple emodl
** extended (modified and re)

project structure:

run scenerios:
    emodl_generation(arg):
        if arg=='age':
            run x_emodl_gen

            ...
    *config_generation(arg):
        ...
        
    run emodl *scenerios of different subsamples/Ki
    
    combine trajectories
    
    *preliminary plotting for QC
    

Potential intermediate processing

    *handle datastructures for age/locale -> longformat by group
            for age groups could look like Ki_{}_{}: ie  Ki_{agegrp1}_{agegrp2}  (contact between agegrp1 and agegrp2)
    
    *Fitting -> might be recursive with run_scenerios
        
    *interventions (could maybe be done in run scenerios)    
        pick multiple Ki values and compare across Ki_{intervention} groups  (product of contact rate and transmission proba)
        can show effect of different interventions.

post-processing:
    calculate incidence
    saves files
        trajectoriesDat
        trajectoriesDat_withIncidence ** this is the main file to use going forward
    

analysis:
    plotting
    *?
    
    
### format:

the final trajectories should be saved in teh simuliation box folder > github. 

decide which files will be stored in which folders.
