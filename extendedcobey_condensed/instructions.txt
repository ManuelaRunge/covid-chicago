### Instructions for Using extendedcobey_condensed.ipynb or extendedcobey_condensed.py ###
### Reese Richardson 4-10-2020 ###

Extended Cobey (Condensed) is a csv-based framework to generate necessary files for running simulations and
for performing basic post-processing on trajectories. It is designed to be incredibly modular and highly
adaptable. That being said, the .ipynb and .py do contain the entire framework necessary to run simulations.

### RUN LOCALLY ON WINDOWS ###
To perform a simulation, you must create a template emodl and a template cfg. Put these in directory alongside
these instructions.txt and the .ipynb or .py. To run on locally on a Windows machine, ensure that the
compartments.exe binary is stored in a directory named 'CMS' neighboring this directory. This is the correct file
architecture:

	CMS ^
		emodl >
		ironscheme >
		models >
		compartments.exe
		compartments.exe.config
		distlib.dll
		IronScheme.dll
		Newtonsoft.Json.dll
		Newtonsoft.Json
		PrngLib.dll
	simulation_1 ^
		extendedcobey_condensed.ipynb
		extendedcobey_condensed_pt1.py
		extendedcobey_condensed_pt2.py
		template.emodl
		template.cfg
		instructions.txt

***NOTE: If you do not want to copy/move your CMS binary, be sure to change the CMS path 
in extendedcobey_condensed_pt1.py!***
All you have to do to run a whole new simulation is copy your current folder and place the duplicate alongside it
(i.e. duplicate simulation_1 as simulation_2 and paste alongside it).
To run, simply execute all cells in the Jupyter notebook in sequence OR
run extendedcobey_condensed_pt1.py file after you have made the necessary adjustments to your model.
This will create a folder for emodls and cfgs, as well as a folder for trajectories.
Next, in Windows Explorer, click on the batch (run_simulations.bat) file and Run as Administrator.
Once this process has completed, the trajectories folder will be populated. To continue, run the remain cells
in the Jupyter notebook OR run extendedcobey_condensed_pt2.py. This will generate your trajectoriesDat.csv
as well as a summary.txt that logs how many runs successfully completed in each simulation.

The original simulation produced here will create 2 samples with 2 scenarios at 2 runs each for a total of 8 trajectories.
Once you have created the correct file architecture or changed the path to your CMS file in 
extendedcobey_condensed_pt1.py, follow the above workflow to try it out!
